# Post Graduation Notes

## Overview

I completed my Software Development course through Code Fellows on November 11, 2021. Now that I'm out of school and in an effort to continue to grow as a developer, I'm going to take the time to look back at what I've accomplished and review the labs we completed. I aim to address the questions I still have, as well as identify areas where I would like to improve, and topics I'd like to study further in depth. The goal of this project is to have sort of a working to-do list.
