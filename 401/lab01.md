# Notes about Lab 01: Snakes Cafe

## Comments/Observations

* I created functions and invoked them in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` if statement
* I created a dictionary to hold the menu offerings AND counts for how many of each item was ordered
* I used .format to fill in the menu section names
* I created an empty dictionary to hold the "order"
* Created a while loop to validate if input was not 'quit'
  * Then checked it against keys in menu to confirm if it was on menu

## Questions

* [ ] What is "dedent" again? How/when do I use it? I tried to remove it from the code and it didn't make any differences, so I'm not entirely sure what it's doing or why.

## To-Do

* [ ] Decorator function for adding border around menu and prompt

* [ ] Handling custom response for plurals in order
  * Examples: "2 order of coffee have been added to your meal," "3 order of cookies have been added to your meal"

* [ ] Adjust spacing between user input and response

* [ ] Adjust quit prompt to not display as key/value pairs
